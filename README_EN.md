# Test Automation Demo_TA for SQL Data Warehousing with SAP HANA

In this repository we have defined a small test package for you. We use the test libraries Mocha and Chai to check the naming conventions of the Calculation Views of the VAL database module.

The test is defined in the file **Demo_TA.js**. 

In the files **package.json** and **package-lock.json** you will find information and lock files for the test package and the individual npm elements.  

Adjustments are not necessary for the defined test in this repository. These are only required in the **Jenkinsfile** of the Demo-repository (https://github.com/ISR-SAP-HANA-SQL-DWH/Demo). 

However, we would appreciate it if you fork changes and suggestions for improvement into this Git repository and thus ensure further development of the test cases.
